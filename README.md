This is the To Do List app for the KPM Power coding challenge 2025. It is built with React (Vite) and TypeScript.

Steps to run locally:
1. Clone or Download the code on Github
2. Make sure you have a package installer like npm or yarn. Use your package installer to install all the dependencies.
```
npm install || yarn install
```
3. Run the app locally by running the run command.
```
npm run dev || yarn run dev
```
4. Play around with the app! If you need to close the server, simply press CTRL + C on the keyboard.

TO DO LIST:
1. add unit testing to test the individual components
2. add localStorage so the data persists
3. fix the "done" part, currently checkbox can't be edited; also change font to "strikethrough" when done for a more satisfying experience
4. make it look nice and responsive to different screen sizes, think about css libraries (tailwind is easiest, but maybe we can just keep it simple with createStylesheet?)
5. think about more visual feedback from a UX perspective
